Read to the end (might save you time)

This is the command for installing cupy on conda
conda install -c conda-forge cupy
HINT: Install cudatoolkit along with this (conda install cudatoolkit) as ig cupy doesn't work without it
The other modules come along with it.
Cupy is only valid if you have a GPU and drivers along with it.

If you seriously want to get started with reading the code I would suggest you to start form under """   Editable Values """.
You can read how the dataset is imported and parameters are generated.
As the functions (like convolve4D and pool) are used in the forward pass you can go up to their definitions if you want
(don't bother asking for documentation, I rarely if ever write documentation as generally I am the only onewho reads this code)

Final point
I am not quite serious about the club and won't be joining even if given the chance (Read the next line tho).
If you seriously find the code interesting, call me for the PI, we can have a chat as I myself am very interested in Deep learning and I'd like to talk to you guys about your sudoku project as I am currently doing something along those lines.
